# 🏈 BrotherhoodBlitzFFL

**Brotherhood Blitz FFL** is your commissioner-grade fantasy football control center — one place to track teams, rivals, trades, drafts, rosters, and all the chaos in between.

This repo powers the league backend/frontend (and all the admin workflows) for the **Brotherhood Blitz Fantasy Football League**.

---

## 📌 TL;DR

- Structured around **areas**:
  - Team & Rival Card  
  - Banner  
  - Profile Drip  
  - Salary Report  
  - Trade Block  
  - Transactions  
  - Draftboard  
  - Rostercard  
  - General/Missing
- Every area has:
  - **Issue labels** (bug, enhancement, docs, etc.)
  - **Issue templates** (pre-labeled, structured forms)
  - **Project views** (Boards & tables per area + global Bugs)

This isn’t a “dump issues wherever” repo — it’s built to keep the chaos under control.

## 🧠 Concept

BrotherhoodBlitzFFL is designed for:

- **League admins/commissioner tools**  
- **UI/UX for league members** (cards, banners, profile drip, draftboards, etc.)
- **Tracking work like a real software project** — not a random Google Sheet

You get:

- Clean breakdown by feature area  
- Built-in triage flow (Status, Priority, Estimate)  
- Project views grouped by **Status** and filtered by **labels**

## 🏷️ Label System

Every area has the same label types:

- `X: enhancement` – improve or add functionality
- `X: documentation` – docs missing/wrong
- `X: duplicate` – same as another issue
- `X: help wanted` – needs extra hands
- `X: invalid` – not reproducible / not an issue
- `X: question` – asks for clarification
- `X: wontfix` – intentionally not doing this

Where **X** is one of:

- `Team & Rival Card`
- `Banner`
- `Profile Drip`
- `Salary Report`
- `Trade Block`
- `Transactions`
- `Draftboard`
- `Rostercard`
- `General/Missing`

There are also **issue templates** for:

- Bug vs Enhancement  
- Per-area (Team & Rival, Banner, Profile Drip, etc.)

Using the correct template auto-applies the **right labels**.
